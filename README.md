**Single-responsibility Principle**
```bash
A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
```

**Open-closed Principle**
```bash
Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
``````

**Liskov substitution principle**
```bash
Every subclass/derived class should be substitutable for their base/parent class without disrupting the behavior of our program.
``````

**Interface segregation principle**
```bash
Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.
``````

**Dependency Inversion principle**
```bash
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
